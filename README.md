# Poker equity calculator

Calculate the equity, win- and tie-percentage of a given hand in Texas Hold'em.

## Usage

### Enumerate

Calculates the equity for all card combinations
with the given community cards, hero hand and villain ranges.
Only useful if not that many combinations are possible.
E.g.:

```
cargo run --release -- enumerate AsTd3h      AhTh   AKo+,AKs+,TT+,33 full
#                                ^           ^      ^                ^
#                                community   hero   villain 1        villain 2 ...
# Output:
# hero:      equity=72.80 win=72.58 tie=0.22
# villain 1: equity=21.60 win=21.47 tie=0.13
# villain 2: equity=5.60 win=5.36 tie=0.23
```

### Simulate

Calculate the equity via Monte Carlo simulation
with the given community cards, hero hand, villain count
and number of rounds.
Not exact, but usually close enough (with 1000000+ rounds
about a 0.1% difference should be expected).
Villain ranges are currently not supported.
E.g.:

```
cargo run --release -- simulate  AsTd3h      AhTh   2               1000000
#                                ^           ^      ^               ^
#                                community   hero   villain count   rounds
# Output:
# hero:      equity=87.96 win=87.50 tie=0.46
# villain 1: equity=6.02 win=5.68 tie=0.34
# villain 2: equity=6.02 win=5.68 tie=0.34
```
